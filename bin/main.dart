// Josephus Problem
// This classic problem dates back to Roman times. There are 41 soldiers arranged
// in a circle. Every third soldier is to be killed by their captors, continuing
// around the circle until only one soldier remains. He is to be freed. Assuming
// you would like to stay alive, at what position in the circle would you stand?
List josephus(int soldiers, int x) {
  //create list of soldiersList with total as length
  List soldiersList = List.generate(soldiers, (i) => i + 1);
  //1,2,3,4,5
  while (soldiersList.length >= x) {
    int remaining = soldiersList.length % x;
    int listLength = soldiersList.length;
    List tempList = [];
    for (int i = listLength - remaining; i < listLength; i++) {
      tempList.add(soldiersList[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= listLength; i++) {
      if (i % x == 0) {
        soldiersList[i - 1] = 0;
      }
    }
    //instead of soldiersList.length it should be a variable which doesn't change, reset it at the end of everything
    // i= soldiersList.length-1  >= soldiersList.length-remaining
    for (int i = listLength - 1; i >= listLength - remaining; i--) {
      soldiersList.removeAt(i);
    }
    soldiersList.removeWhere((x) => x == 0);
    var list = []..addAll(tempList)..addAll(soldiersList);
    soldiersList = list;
  }
  return soldiersList;
}

//this function when soldiers list length reduces to less than x. that is if every 3rd soldier
//is to be killed then total number of soldiers left are 2
int trimMore(var numbers, int x) {
//     int x=3;
//   List<int> numbers =[10,4];
  while (numbers.length <= x) {
    for (int i = 0; numbers.length < x; i++) {
      numbers.add(numbers[i]);
    }

    int removeNumber = numbers[numbers.length - 1];
    numbers.removeWhere((x) => x == removeNumber);

    List<int> unique = numbers.toSet().toList();
    if (unique.length == 1) {
      x = unique[0];

}
// Generalize this problem by creating a function that accepts the number of
// soldiers n and the interval at which they are killed i, and returns the
// position of the fortunate survivor.

// Challenge 3
// Movie Theater Seating
// A group of n friends are going to see a movie. They would like to find a spot
// where they can sit next to each other in the same row. A movie theater's seat
// layout can be represented as a 2-D matrix, where 0s represent empty seats and
// 1s represent taken seats.

// Create a function that, given a seat layout and the number of friends n,
// returns the number of available spots for all n friends to sit together.
//
//Examples
//groupSeats([
//[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
//[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
//[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
//[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
//[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
//[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
